      <h4> Information for participants <h4>

        <h5> What is this study about? </h5>
          <p>The novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) is keeping us all on edge. In order to get this pandemic under control, we had to take strict measures in the last few months. Now life is gradually returning to its normal state. However, to keep the virus under control, we still need to detect any resurgence of the disease. For that we have to be able to test as many people as possible for the virus as easily as possible. We are testing a procedure for this, and would like to ask you for your help. </p>
        <h5> How does a regular test for the virus work? </h5>
          <p>  Individuals, who might have gotten infected with the novel coronavirus, are usually asked by the public health office (Gesundheitsamt) or their physician, to take a oropharyngeal swab sample. For this, a health care specialist inserts a swab test stick (something like a long Q-tip) through mouth or nose into the throat to collect material (secretion and cells). In a medical laboratory, the sample will be tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The laboratory method used for this is called "qPCR".</p>

        <h5> What do we want to do differently? </h5>
          <p> The method we want to test differs in two points:</p>
            <ol>
              <li> We want to use saliva instead of oropharyngeal swabs as it has several advantages:
                <ul>
                  <li> It is rather unpleasant to take an oropharyngeal swab. Spitting into a tube is much more easy and less unpleasant. </li>
                  <li> Taking an oropharyngeal swab sample needs to be performed by medical professionals and you need to visit a medical office or a test station. Saliva samples on the other hand can be easily taken at home. We explain in a video, how to do it correctly. </li>
                </ul>
              <li> We want to implement a different analysis method in the laboratory. Instead of the regular "qPCR"-method, we want to test an alternative, requiring less technical effort, called "LAMP". </li>
            </ol>

          <h5> Is our test as good as the "official" test? </h5>
          <p> We are not able to definitively answer this question yet. Hence, we want to test this method. So far, we can state the following: </p>
              <ul>
                <li> During the last months, it became evident in multiple studies, that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saliva samples comparably well as in the regular oropharyngeal swab samples. Numerous points are indicative that the unpleasant oropharyngeal swab can be replaced by saliva sample analysis. How exactly to collect your saliva ideally, is yet not fully clear (see below). </li>
                <li> Neither laboratory methods, qPCR or LAMP, are perfect: If a sample contains only few virus particles, an infection can be overlooked. The well established qPCR method is clearly better in identifying samples with few virus particles as infected, compared to the LAMP method we want to test. If our test does not detect virus particles in your sample, it is less reliable than a negative qPCR result. </li>
                <li>  On the other hand, the LAMP method is technically much simpler. By the same laboratory capacity and the same number of technical assistances, more people can be tested, compared to qPCR analysis. </li>
              </ul>

        <h5> How do I participate? </h5>

            <ol>
              <li>  You should have received a small tube (a little tube with a screw cap). It contains some salty water (5 mL clean water with 0.9% salt). </li>
              <li>  First, you should read these information here and, if you agree with everything, confirm at the end of this page by a mouse click that you are willing to participate. </li>
              <li> We will ask you on the next page to enter your contact data ( so the public health office (Gesundheitsamt) can contact you, in case of a detected infection), as well as you barcode on your test tube. Your name and contact information will be encrypted and stored in a way that we (the Heidelberg University team) cannot access or read them. Only employees of the public health office, who supervises this study, have access to your contact information. </li>
              <li> Thereafter, please watch a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVniPRMuCjo&feature=emb_title">video clip</a> that will show you how to take your saliva sample. </li>
              <li> Now please prepare your sample as shown in the video. </li>
              <li> Ship the sample by mail or deliver it to a collection point. You find the instructions on after submitting your barcode. </li>
            </ol>

        <p> <b> Required time: </b> In total, the whole procedure should take 15 to 25 minutes. It might take less time, if you know the video already, or more time, if your next drop-off point is farther away. </p>

        <h5> What happens, when SARS-CoV-2 is detected in your sample? </h5>
          <p> If we can detect SARS-CoV-2 by our LAMP method (positive result), we inform the public health office about the result and the respective barcode on the test tube. Furthermore, we will double check the result by the established qPCR method, to not give a false alarm. </p>
          <p> The public health office will then contact and inform you. Typically, you will be asked tp quarantine yourself. They will counsel you and try to identify people you might have infected with your assistance to contain further spread of the virus. </p>
          <p> We (the Heidelberg University team) will not learn you identity. Only the public health office will be able to associate the test results and their corresponding barcodes to the personal information. </p>

        <h5> What does it mean, if we don't find the virus in your sample? </h5>
          <p> You can inquire your test result yourself <a href="result-query.html">here</a>. Even if it is negative (the virus has not been detected), it does not mean an all-clear signal! Please keep in mind that our test is not perfect and may only detect 60% to 80% of all infections by a rough estimation. Moreover, even if the virus should not be detected in your saliva sample, you might have gotten infected soon after taking the sample. Or you might have been infected just before taking the sample and there were not enough virus particles produced to be detected in your saliva. </p>
          <p> As long as the virus is in circulation, we all must be careful and observe all hygiene and distance regulations. A negative test result does not change this! </p>

        <h5> If the study was successfull, what would be the profit for all of us? </h5>
          <p> Certainly, you have heard in the news about city districts, regions or businesses, where an outbreak had unexpectedly occurred. After some people had shown symptoms, their surroundings were tested (with qPCR) just to uncover that a great number of people had been already infected. As a result, many people were needed to go into quarantine and contact restrictions were tightened again in entire towns or districts. To prevent this, we need to test in closer networks, for example: in one town or city we could regularly ask a group of the residents (a different group every week) to give a saliva sample. The more often this is done, the higher is the chance, to detect an outbreak early on, when only a few people are infected. We would like to try out such an approach here. </p>
          <p> We have to ponder whether we should run as many tests as possible, even if the individual tests are not as accurate as possible, or we should use the most accurate tests, even if we can then run significantly fewer tests? If the former is the better strategy, our study will show, how to test on large scale, potentially throughout Germany. </p>

        <h5> Who conducts the study and how is it financed? </h5>
          <p> This study is being conducted by a team from Heidelberg University. A list of the participating scientists can be found here: [INSERT LINK].  We are also supported by the local health authorities who receive the contact details and the results and inform people with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
          <p> This study is financed by the Baden-Württemberg Ministry for Science and Arts (Ministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst Baden-Württemberg) and receives funding from Heidelberg University (in that way by all of you, the tax-paying citizens of the state Baden-Württemberg. Thank you very much.) </p>

        <h5> What is your profit for taking part? </h5>
          <p> If you are actually infected with SARS-CoV-2, there is a high chance (yet not for sure) that our test will detect this. Once you know you are infected, you can quarantine and, by doing so, protect your family, friends, fellows and colleagues from getting infected. Additionally, you would learn earlier the cause of your symptoms, in case of severe illness. </p>
          <p> If you test negative for SARS-CoV-2, however, it must not be interpreted as a "carte blanche" to neglect hygiene and distance regulations. Because the test cannot reliably rule out the infection. </p>

        <h5> Does taking part bear risks for the participant? </h5>
          <p> Taking a saliva sample does not bear any physical risks for you. The big tube contains sterile salty water, it's content is absolutely harmless. </p>

        <h5> Who should participate? </h5>
          <p> Everyone, who received a test kit is besought to take part in the study. Distribution of the test kits is typically organized by the public health office (Gesundheitsamt), or delegated to another office. One further prerequisite for taking part is for you to declare, that you feel sufficiently informed by the information available here and that you agree to the explained method. </p>

        <h5> How do we guarantee the safety of your data? </h5>
          <p> We, the Heidelberg university team, only work with your barcoded test tubes. This is called pseudonymization, meaning that instead of your name, birth date, etc, we exclusively work with a numeric / alphanumeric code. The public health office, on the other hand, have access to the data you enter on the website (your name, address, phone numer and / or email address) and can link those information to the code on your test tube. This is necessary, since Covid-19 is by law subject to registration. The public health office must be informed of the identity of infected people. Therefore, we forward all sample codes with positive test results to the public health office, allowing them to contact infected people and take further action. </p>
          <p> The web server on which you enter your data is set up in such a way that only clearly designated employees of the Health office and not us (the scientists at Heidelberg University) have access to the names and contact details of the registered people.</p>
          <p> The office that issues test tubes may not ask for their name and may not make any records that link the codes on the test tubes with the names of the test persons. If you suspect that the issuing office has noted down the code of your test tube and your name, please inform us.</p>

        <h5> Further information regarding data protection </h5>
          <p> All data protection regulations are being obeyed, as well as medical obligation to secrecy regulations, in the context of the infection prevention law (Infektionsschutzgesetz). During the study, no clinical report will be produced, but only the code on your test tube as well as your contact information will be recorded. These data will be stored in a data base exclusively accessible to employees of the public health office. Additionally, information in the context of distribution of the sample tubes will be stored, i.e. location and date of distribution. </p>
          <p> Statistical data, important for this study, will be anonymized by the public health office and forwarded to the organizers of the study. The study coordinator will implement all necessary measures, to protect your data according to data protection standards of the European Union. The data are protected against unauthorized access. Data can only be decrypted by the public health office. Data collected during this study, will be destroyed after the completion of the study.</p>
          <p> You have the right to request information about your personal data from the study coordinator. Additionally, you may demand correction of faulty data, as well as deletion of all data, or limit their processing.</p>

          <h5> Is participation voluntary? Can you retract your consent? </h5>
            <p> Participation is voluntary. If you do not wish to participate, just don't fill in the online form and discard your test tube, or give it to someone else, who wants to participate and get tested. Participation is free of charges. If you already gave your consent and also already handed in your test tube, please contact the study coordinator. You find the contact information on the webpage. Upon retraction of your consent, your personal data will be deleted, your result can then not be allocated to you. Upon retracting your consent, already generated material can be destroyed, if you wish so. If your sample was already analyzed, e.g. because you contacted us too late, and your sample was already tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, we will still forward the information about the positive test result with the respective barcode to the public health office, as we are by law obliged to do so (Infektionsschutzgesetz). </p>
