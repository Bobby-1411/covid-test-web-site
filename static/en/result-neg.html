    <h3> Negative Test Result </h3>
      <p class="lead">The CoVID-19 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was <strong> not </strong> detected in your sample. You are most likely not infected.</h3>

      <p class="lead"> <strong>However, please keep in mind</strong>:  </h5>
      <ul class="lead">
        <li> Our test is not perfect and not as sensitive as the "official" PCR test. It might miss some infections. </li>
        <li> The virus might not have been detected in your saliva, but may reside somewhere else in your body.</li>
        <li> You might have gotten infected only after taking your sample.</li>
        <li> You may meet someone who will infect you. </li>
      </p>

      <p class="lead"> <b>Therefore:</b> Please stay careful. Keep distance to others, wear a mask in public spaces and continue to observe all rules and regulations to minimize the risk of infection.</p>
