      <p> To participate in our test, you need a test kit. The kits comprise a contained with salted water, a small tube with a barcode sticker, and a plastic pipette.</p>
      <p> We distribute these kits during specific testing events, e.g. we test all employees of a place of work. Only those who received a test kit in this manner may participate. </p>
      <p> Please understand that the effort of a testing event make sense to us only where it allows for testing a substantial number of people. Therefor, we cannot offer this test to individuals. However, if you want to support us by organizing a testing event for a group of people, please <a href="impressum.html">contact us</a>.</p>
