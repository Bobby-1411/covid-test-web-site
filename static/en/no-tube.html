      <p> Our test kit consists of a bigger tube with salty water, a smaller tube with a barcode, and a plastic pipette.</p>
      <p> We are distributing these kits as test actions, e.g. do we test all employees of an institute. Only those who received a test kit in this manner may participate. </p>
      <p> Please understand that the effort of a test action only then is worthwhile doing, when it allows us testing a bigger number of persons. We can therefore not offer this test to individuals. However, if you want to support us, and want to organize a test action for a bigger group of people, please contact is with your proposal. [Link to Impressum Page]</p>
