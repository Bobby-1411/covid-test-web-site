    <h3> Your sample has been analyzed but the result is not yet conclusive </h3>
      <p class="lead">In a small number of our tests (less than 1 in 200) the result is inconclusive. This may be because the test yielded a false positive result, or the sample is very weakly positive and we are not sure. </p>
      <p class="lead">To verify this, we re-analyze these samples by RT-qPCR and using a kit in the viral diagnostics unit. This takes a maximum of 24 hours.</p>
      <p class="lead"> For you this means that you should be careful â€“ wear a mask and follow the distancing rules. </p>
      <p class="lead"><strong>You need to check back here in about 24 hours to get the diagnostic result.</strong></p>
      <p class="lead">It is possible that you are in the early stages of an infection, or in a very late stage of the infection, and therefore you have (still) very low values.
        Rarely an inconclusive Result can be caused by a contamination in your sample that can influence our test and therefore we get an unclear result. A diagnostic test using RT-qPCR helps us to clarify the situation.</p>
      <p class="lead">If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
