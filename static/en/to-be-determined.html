      <h5>We are very sorry for this! Unfortunately, we always have a small fraction of samples with inconclusive results. </h5>
      <h5>These are mostly false positives. We are reanalysing these samples by RT-qPCR in order to obtain a conclusive result. This process takes maximum 24 hours. Since you have reached this page, it means that your sample is among the ones that are being retested in order to obtain a conclusive result. </h5>
      <h5> Stay tuned, we are doing our best.</h5>
