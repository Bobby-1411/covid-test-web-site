    <h3>Possibly positive</h3>
    <p>Your sample might be positive: Our initial analysis has detected the Covid19 coronavirus. However, this test sometimes gives false alarms. Therefore, we have handed over your sample to the virological diagnostic laboratory of the University Hospital, where the result is now being verified. If you check your result againb on the evening of teh day after handing in the sample (again using this page, entering your code and password as you have done now), you will see the final result.</p>

    <p>Until then, please be very careful: Stay at home and keep pplenty of distance to other people.</p>

    <p>If you like to, you can contact the study organizers, Michael Knop (0152-54756440) or Simon Anders (0176-59535777).</p>
