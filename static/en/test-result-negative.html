      <p>The CoVID-19 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was <strong> not </strong> detected in your sample. You are most likely not infected.</p>

      <p> <strong> But please consider: </strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Our test is not perfect and not as sensitive as the "official" PCR-test. Individual infections may therefore not be detected. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Even if the virus was not detected in your sample: The virus might not have been detected in your saliva, but may reside somewhere else in your body. You may have gotten infected after taking your sample, or you may meet someone tomorrow, who will infect you. </li>
      </ul>

      <p> <b>Therefore:</b> Please: stay alert. Keep distance to others, wear a mask in public spaces and keep on respecting all rules and regulations to minimize the risk of infection.</p>
