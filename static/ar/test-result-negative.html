      <p>The CoVID-19 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was <strong> not </strong> detected in your sample. You are most likely not infected.</p>

      <p> <strong> However </strong>, please keep in mind:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Our test is not perfect and not as sensitive as the "official" PCR test. It might miss some infections. </li>
        <li> The virus might not have been detected in your saliva, but may reside somewhere else in your body. Also, you might have gotten infected only after taking your sample, or you may even meet someone tomorrow, who will infect you. </li>
      </ul>

      <p> <b>Therefore:</b> Please stay careful. Keep distance to others, wear a mask in public spaces and continue to observe all rules and regulations to minimize the risk of infection.</p>
