        <h3> What is this study about? </h3>
          <p> The novel coronavirus, scientifically: SARS-CoV-2, keeps us all in suspense. To get a grip on the Covid-19 pandemic, we all had to strongly testrict us in the last few months. Now, the public life is gathering pace again. To keep the virus under control, we need to early on recognize, when infections are becoming more frequent in certain regions. For this, we need to test as many people as possible in an uncomplicated manner for SARS-CoV-2. To do so, we are testing a method at the moment, and hope for your support.  </p>

        <h3> How does a regular test for the virus work? </h3>
          <p>  Individuals, who might have gotten infected with the novel coronavirus, are usually asked by the public health office (Gesundheitsamt) or their physician, to take a oropharyngeal swab sample. For this, a health care specialist inserts a swab test stick (something like a long Q-tip) through mouth or nose into the throat to collect material (secretion and cells). In a medical laboratory, the sample will be tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The laboratory method used for this is calles "qPCR".</p>

        <h3> What do we want to do differently? </h3>
          <p> The method we want to test differs in two points:
            <ol>
              <li> We want to use saliva instead oropharyngeal swabs. This has several advantages:
                <ul>
                  <li> It is rather unpleasent to take an oropharyngeal swab. Spitting into a tube is much more easy and less unpleasant. </li>
                  <li> Taking an oropharyngeal swab sample needs to be performed by medical professionals and you need to visit a medical office or a test station. Saliva samples on the other hand can heasly be taken at home. We explain in a video, how to do it correctly. </li>
                </ul>
              <li> We want to implement a different analysis method in the laboratory. Instead of the regular "qPCR"-method, we want to test an alternative, requiring less technical effort, called "LAMP". </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h3> Is our test as good as the "official" test? </h3>
          <p> We can not definitely answer this question yet, which is why we want to test this method. So far, we can state the following:
              <ul>
                <li> During the last months, it became evident in multiple studies, that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saliva samples comparably well as in the regular oropharyngeal swab samples. Numerous points are indicative that the unpleasant oropharyngeal swab can be replaced by saliva sample analysis. How exactly to collect your saliva ideally, is yet not fully clear (see below). </li>
                <li> Neither laboratory method, qPCR or LAMP, is perfect: If a sample contains only few virus particles, an infection can be overseen. The well established qPCR method is clearly better in identifying samples with few virus particles as infected, compared to the LAMP method we want to test. If our test does not detect virus particles in your sample, it is a less reliable than a negative qPCR result. </li>
                <li>  On the other hand, the LAMP method is technically much simpler. With the same laboratory capacity and the same number of technical assistances, many more people can be tested, as it would be possible by qPCR analysis. </li>
              </ul>
          </p>

        <h3> How do I participate? </h3>

            <ol>
              <li>  You should have received a small tube (a little cup with a screw cap). It contains some salty water (5 mL clean water with 0.9% table salt). </li>
              <li>  First, you should read these information here and, if you agree with everything, confirm at the end of this page by a mouse click that you are willing to participate. </li>
              <li> We will ask you on the next page to enter your contact data ( so that the public health office (Gesundheitsamt) can contact you, in case of a detected infection), as well as you barcode on your test tube. Your name and contact information will be encrypted and stored, so that we (the Heidelberg University Team) can not access or read them, but only employees of the public health office, who supervises this study. </li>
              <li> Thereafter, please watch a short video clip [INSERT LINK] that will show you exactly how to take your saliva sample. </li>
              <li> Now prepare your sample as shown in the video. </li>
              <li> Ship the sample by mail or deliver it to a collection point. You find instructions on this webpage. </li>
            </ol>

        <p> <b> Time investment: </b> Totally, the whole procedure should take 15-25 minutes of your time. It may take less time, if you know the video already, or more time, if your next mailbox is farther away. </p>

        <h3> What happens, when SARS-CoV-2 is detected in your sample? </h3>
          <p> If we can detect SARS-CoV-2 by our LAMP method (positive result), we inform the public health office about the result and the respective barcode on the test tube. Furthermore, we will double check the result by the established qPCR method, to not give false alarm. </p>
          <p> The public health office will the contact and inform you. Typically, you will be asked to resort yourself into domestic quarantine, counsel you, and, together with you, try to identify people you might have infected, so that a further spread of the virus can be contained. </p>
          <p> We (the Heidelberg University Team) will not learn you identity. The public health office alone will be able to connect the test results / the barcodes with your personal information. </p>

        <h3> What does it mean, if we don't find the virus in your sample? </h3>
          <p> You can query your on result yourself on this webpage: (Link: [INSERT LINK]). Even if it was negative (the virus has not been detected), it would not equal an all-clear signal! Please keep in mind that our test is not perfect and may (roughly estimated) only detect 60-80% of all infections. Furthermore: Even if the virus was not detected in your saliva sample, you might have gotten infected soon after taking the sample. Or you might have also been infected before taking the sample, so that not enough virus particles might have yet been produced to be diagnosed in your saliva. </p>
          <p> As long as the virus circulates, we always need to pay attention to regard all hygiene - and distance regulations. A negative test result does not change this! </p>

        <h3> If the study was sucessfull, what would be the profit for all of us? </h3>
          <p> Certainly, you have heard in the news about city districts, regions or companies, where an outbreak occured. After some people showed symptoms, their environment was tested (by qPCR) to realize, that numerous people have been infected already. Therefore, large groups of people needed to quarantine and in complete cities or counties, contact resrictions were tightened. To prevent this, we need to test in closer meshes, for example: Some citizens of a city could be regularly asked (e.g. every week another group) to provide saliva samples. The more often this is done, the higher is the chance, to uncover an outbreak early on, when only a few people are yet infected. We want to test the possibility of such an approach. </p>
          <p> We need to ponder: Should as many tests as possible be done, even of the individual test may not be as exact as possible, or should one take the most accurate tests, even if far less tests would be possible? If the former is the better strategy, our study will show, how to test on large scale, potentially even Germany-wide. </p>

        <h3> Who conducts the study and how is it financed? </h3>
          <p> This study is conducted by a University Heidelberg Team. Find a list of all involved scientists here: [INSERT LINK]. Moreover, public health offices (Gesundheitsämter) are supporting our efforts. Those receive your contact details and test results, and inform persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
          <p> This study is financed by funds of the Baden-Württemberg Ministry for Science and Arts (Ministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst Baden-Württemberg) and funds from Heidelberg University (and in that way by all of you, the tex-paying citizens of the state Baden-Württemberg. Thank you very much.) </p>

        <h3> What is your profit for taking part? </h3>
          <p> If you are indeed SARS-CoV-2 infected, there is a high chance (yet no certainty) that our test will detect this. Once you know you are infected, you can quarantine and, by doing so, protect your family, friends, fellows and colleagues from getting infected. Additionaly, you may learn earlier the cause of your symptoms, in case you may fall seriously sick. </p>
          <p> If you test negative for SARS-CoV-2, it must not be interpreted as a "carte blanche" to neglect hygiene and distance regulations. The test can not certainly exclude an infection. </p>

        <h3> Does taking part bear risks for the participant? </h3>
          <p> Taking a saliva sample does not bear any physical risks for you. The big tube contains sterile salty water, it's content is absolutely harmless. </p>

        <h3> Who should participate? </h3>
          <p> Everyone, who received a test kit is besought to take part in the study. Distribution of the test kits is typically organized by the public health office (Gesundheitsamt), or delegated to another office. One further prerequisite for taking part is for you to declare, that you feel sufficiently informed by the here available information, and that you agree to the described method. </p>

        <h3> How do we guarantee the safety of your data? </h3>
          <p> We, the Heidelberg university Team, only work with your barcoded test tubes. This is calles pseudonymization, meaning that instead of your name, birth date, etc, we exclusively work with a numeric / alphanumeric code. The public health office on the other hand, can access your data, that you enter on the webpage (Name, address, phone numer and / or email address) and can link those information to the code on your test tube. This is necessary, since Covid-19 is by law subject to registration: The public health office therefore needs to be informed about your identity. Therefore, we forward all sample codes with positive test results to the public health office, allowing them to contact infected people and to implement further measure. </p>
          <p> Der Webserver, auf dem Sie Ihre Daten eingeben, ist so aufgesetzt, dass nur klar bestimmte Mitarbeiter des Gesundheitsamtes, nicht aber wir (die Wissenschaftler der Universität Heidelberg) Zugriff auf Namen und Kontaktdaten der Probanden haben. </p>
          <p> Die Stelle, die Teströhrchen ausgibt, darf nicht nach ihrem Namen fragen und darf keine Aufzeichnungen anfertigen, die die Codes auf den Teströhrchen mit den Namen der Probanden verknüpft. Wenn Sie den Verdacht haben, dass sich die ausgebende Stelle den Code Ihres Teströhrchens und Ihren Namen notiert haben, informieren Sie uns bitte unbedingt. </p>

        <h3> Further information regarding data protection </h3>
          <p> All data protection regulations are being obeyed, as well as medical obligation to secrecy regulations, in the context of the infection prevention law (Infektionsschutzgesetz). During the study, no clinical report will be produced, but only the code on your test tube as well as your contact information will be recorded. These data will be stored in a data base exclusively accessible to employees of the public health office. Additionally, information in the context of distributing the sample tubes will be stored, i.e. location and date of distributing the sample tube. </p>
          <p> Statistical data, important for this study, will be anonymized by the public health office and forwarded to the organizers of the study. The study coordinator will implement all necessary measures, to protect your data according to data protection standards of the European Union. The data are protected against unauthorized access. Data can only be decrypted by the public health office. Data collected during the study, will be destroyed after study completion.</p>
          <p> You have the right to enquire about information about your stored data by the study coordinator. Additionaly, you may demand correction of faulty data, as well as deletion iof all data, or limit their processing.</p>

          <h3> Is participation voluntary? Can you retract your consent? </h3>
            <p> Participating is voluntary. If you do not wish to participate, just don't fill in the online forms and discard your test tube, or give it to someone else, who wants to participate and get tested. Participation is free of charges. If you already gave your consent and also already handed in your test tube, please contact the study coordinator. You find the contact information on the webpage. Upon retraction of your consent, your personal data will be deleted, your result can then not be allocated to your person. Upon retracting your consent, already generated material can be destroyed, if you wish so. If your sample was already analyzed, e.g. because you contacted us too late, and your sample was already tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, we will still forward the information about the positive test result with the respective barcode to the public health office, as we are by law required to do so (Infektionsschutzgesetz). </p>
