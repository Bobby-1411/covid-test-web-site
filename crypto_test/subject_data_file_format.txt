The data supplied by the users are stored in a CSV (comma-seperated values) file, 
with one line for each form entry.


For each record (i.e., each line of a file), a new AES session is instantiated, with
randomly generated session key and initialization vector.


The fields are as follows:


Field 0: sample barcode, encoded as follows:

  -- the sample barcode, in plain ASCII


Field 1: time stamp (local time at data storing)

  -- YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss, stored as plain text


Field 2: hash of user password, encoded as follows:

  -- plain-text password in unicode
  -> encode in UTF-8 
  -> cryptographically hash with SHA3-384 
  -> encode with Base64


Field 3: the AES session key, RSA-encrypted as follows

  -- 16 random bytes, randomly generated anew for each line, used as key for AES encryption 
  -> encrypt with PKCS1/OAEP, using the 3072-bit RSA public key in 'public.pem'
  -> encode with Base64


Field 4: the IV of the AES cipher instance for Field 2

   -- initialization vector (IV), randomly generated when instantiating AES encryption 
   -> encode with Base-64


Fields 5-7: the user's contact details, AES-encrypted as follows

  -- plain-text data as entered 
  -> encode in UTF-8 
  -> pad with zeroes to a length that is a multiple of 16
  -> encrypt with AES in mode CBC, using the session key stored in Field 3
  -> encode with Base64

  the individual fields are:

     Field 5: name
     Field 6: home address
     Field 7: contact (phone number or e-mail address )
